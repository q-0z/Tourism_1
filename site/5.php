					With its ethnicity and rich culture Rajasthan is another destination which attracts a lot of tourist from around the world. With some exciting tourist place in Rajasthan, this destination has made its place on the bucket list of a traveller. Rajasthan which was known by the name Rajputana or the land of the king is the biggest state in the republic of India. It covers a zone of 342,239 sq kilometers which is 10.4% of India. However, notwithstanding of its huge size, it is secured by the Great Indian Desert, Thar.

					The Thar Desert runs parallel to the Sutlej-Indus waterway valley. Being situated at the cutting edge of Indian development, the territory of Rajasthan has seen the time of the kings, clarifying the moniker 'the land of the kings'. Rajasthan houses a stunning showcase of expressions and architecture politeness of it being a royal state. Every individual kingdom of Rajasthan has a particular style of design and expressions making it a standout amongst the most socially assorted places on the planet.

					Other than the curlicue moustaches, splendidly shaded turbans and substantial silver decorations, Rajasthan is about enormous slope fortifications, glimmering royal residences, glorious sanctuaries and religious spots, exhibition halls, craftsmanship displays and dynamic bazaars. The cultural potpourri and the decadence of a bygone era of Rajasthan when it was Rajputana, governed by a few warrior rulers have made a mark in history.
