					Right at the foothills of the Himalayas, Darjeeling attracts all those who wish to experience life as it once was before the days of modernization. While lovers and honeymooners travel to the town and book themselves in cozy cottages to enjoy private time away from the city, the tired travellers go soul searching in the hills.

The most popular activities in Darjeeling were once trekking, camping and bird watching, but over the years, a new discovery has been made. White water rafting is fast becoming the most popular activity in Darjeeling. Unmatched in thrill and action, this is the best way to experience the gushing waters of the Teesta and Rangeet rivers.

With the incredible views of the Kanchenjunga from the Tiger Hill, the quaint monasteries of Darjeeling and Ghoom, and that spiritual shopping experience you’ll enjoy at Tibetan Refugee Centre and the curio shops on the Mall, there’s way more to Darjeeling than one may think.

We recommend finding yourself a quiet corner to spend your afternoon reveling in solitude and peace. Watch the sun set over the hills bathing the evening in ethereal light. Don’t forget to mark a perfect ending to your Darjeeling tour - with a ride on the Toy Train watching the hills amble by as the train chugs through the mountainside. It's pure magic.
