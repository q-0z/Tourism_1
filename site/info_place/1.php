					Hyderabad (/ˈhaɪdərəˌbɑːd/ (About this sound listen)
					HY-dər-ə-bAHd; often /ˈhaɪdrəˌbɑːd/) is the capital of the
					 Indian state of Telangana and de jure capital of Andhra Pradesh.
					 [A] Occupying 650 square kilometres (250 sq mi) along the banks of the Musi
					  River, it has a population of about 6.7 million and a metropolitan
						 population of about 7.75 million, making it the fourth most populous
						 city and sixth most populous urban agglomeration in India. At an average
						  altitude of 542 metres (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly
							terrain around artificial lakes, including Hussain Sagar—predating the city's
							founding—north of the city centre.
					Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad remained under the
					rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region.
					 In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty,
					 known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the
					 British Raj, and remained so for 150 years, with the city serving as its capital.
					 The city continued as the capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the
					 Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the States
					 Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in the city has been
					 the winter office of the President of India. In 2014, the newly formed state of
					 Telangana split from Andhra Pradesh and the city became the joint capital of the
					  two states, a transitional arrangement scheduled to end by 2025.
